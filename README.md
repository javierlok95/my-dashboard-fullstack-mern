### **Description**
Welcome to My Dashboard - FullStack(MERN), showcasing my expertise as a front-end developer and back-end developer for a data management application project using the full-stack MERN that stands for (MongoDb, Express, React and Node). In this app you will find administrator having access to an extensive overview of their business with all the relevant data about their products, customer, transaction even graph of where our users are located and purchasing patterns, that adds an extra layer of insight. This way, the administrator can identify trends, target specific markets, and optimize strategies based on data-driven decisions.

This project is fully functional to some extend but visually appealing with an incorporation of Material UI to give this touch.
